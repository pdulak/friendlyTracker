# looserTracker

My first Node.js / Express web application.

Setup
----------
Install dependencies by using: **npm install**
Install nodemon: **npm install -g nodemon**

Running
----------
+ Run app with debug by using: **DEBUG=looserTracker:\* npm start**
+ Run app with debug and nodemon using: **DEBUG=looserTracker:\* nodemon ./bin/www**

Things I learned so far:

+ basics of Express error handling (I was not able to crash an app using stupid errors in my code)
+ how to reload an application if code changes: **nodemon**
+ basics of handlebars
+ basics of PureCSS
+ request and response objects basics
+ how to execute code at the start and end of each Request
